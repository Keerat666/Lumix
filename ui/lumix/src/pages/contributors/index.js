        <p>
          Hey there, I'm Gurkeerat, and you might know me as "keerat666" on
          GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm on an exciting journey of transitioning into the world of open
          source because I genuinely believe that coding should be within
          everyone's reach. It's a powerful tool for change, innovation, and
          self-expression, and I'm committed to making it accessible to all who
          want to pick it up.

          You can know more about me at {" "}

        <p>
          Lumix is a project close to my heart, and it reflects this vision.
          It's a platform where creativity meets code, and together, we're
          building an outstanding UI library for all. Feel free to connect with
          me anytime; I'm here to help and collaborate.
